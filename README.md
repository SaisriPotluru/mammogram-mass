# Mammogram-mass

It is used to predict weather the mammogram mass is benign or malignant.
The variables are 

   1. BI-RADS assessment: 1 to 5 (ordinal)  
   2. Age: patient's age in years (integer)
   3. Shape: mass shape: round=1 oval=2 lobular=3 irregular=4 (nominal)
   4. Margin: mass margin: circumscribed=1 microlobulated=2 obscured=3 ill-defined=4 spiculated=5 (nominal)
   5. Density: mass density high=1 iso=2 low=3 fat-containing=4 (ordinal)
   6. Severity: benign=0 or malignant=1 (binominal)
   
   
   
The different types of models are build such as decision trees,random forest classifier , SVM (linear and poly),K- nearest neighbours,logistic regression and neural networks.
